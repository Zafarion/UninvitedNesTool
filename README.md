NES Uninvited text dumper/Inserter (Romhacking Tool)

Unfinished text extractor/reinserter of the NES game called Uninvited I've coded about a decade ago. Like the SGCTOOL (Shadowgate Tool) I've also uploaded here, it dumps all text dialogues and item names/descriptions and even tries to insert back, but unlike Shadowgate, the game text gets screwed after some minutes of gameplay. Unfortunately the text compression is not the same as Shadowgate. But at least, after a couple years I've coded this, I found another dumper/inserter here in github called hUninvited that was coded in golomb and seems to work flawlessly. Unfortunately I was unable to understand a single line of this golomb code to fix mine.

In 'Table directory' you need to select the included "Uninvited-antigo.tbl" file.
